My Python Journey
README is a misnomer, there is no reason for you to read this.
You were warned. 
Maybe you needed to get some sleep and you wanted help....in that case feel free to read below.

species - "cat"
if species =- "cat":
  print("Yep, it's a cat.")
  print("Has it been a minute? Can we get a cat yet?")

== to compare if two things are equal
!= to compare if two things are not equal
>= to see greater than or equal to
<= to see if lesser than or equal to
